Welcome to Chronicle (Version 9.3)
A free, AI-powered document extraction tool built for accessibility and historical research.

IMPORTANT: DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY DISCLAIMER
Chronicle is a local bridge to an online service. When you run this tool, your documents are encrypted and uploaded to Google's Gemini API for processing. They are not processed on your computer's hard drive.
* Public/Historical Documents: Safe to upload.
* Sensitive/Private Documents: Please exercise caution. Do not upload financial records, medical documents, or unredacted personal data unless you are comfortable with Google's Cloud Data Policy.
* Data Retention: This script does not save your data. Once the session is closed, Chronicle has no memory of your files.

Core Features (What This Tool Actually Does)
Chronicle is not a standard scanner. It uses a "Vision-Language" AI to read documents like a human would.

1. Batch Directory Scanning: Capable of recursively scanning a target directory and all its sub-folders to process multiple files automatically. Includes a "Cleanup" mode to delete original files after successful conversion.

2. Optimized Chunking Logic: The PDF processing engine chunks documents in strictly limited 5-page segments. This ensures that massive or dense manuals are read with total completeness.

3. Technical Manual Accessibility:
* UI & Button Translation: Automatically translates visual icons and symbols in user manuals into explicit spoken text (e.g., [Settings Gear Icon]).
* Device Schematic Reconstruction: Rebuilds visual diagrams of devices into clean, linear lists mapping out the location of buttons and ports.

4. Military Archive Intelligence:
* Telegraph Decoder: Converts the word "STOP" in telegraphs into actual punctuation.
* Grid Reference Isolation: Formats military map coordinates with spaced digits for easy dictation.
* Casualty Table Rebuilder: Reconstructs packed nominal rolls into strictly scoped tables.
* Classification Stamping: Pulls diagonal security stamps (e.g., TOP SECRET) and places them clearly at the top.

5. Screen Reader Optimization: Outputs clean, semantic HTML, Markdown, or Word docs.

6. Form Flattening: Takes messy visual tax forms and "flattens" them into a clean, vertical list.

7. Checkbox Detection: Explicitly reads out if a checkbox is checked or empty.

8. Strikethrough Recovery: Reads text that has been crossed out, so you don't miss corrections.

9. Visual Scene Descriptions: Writes detailed descriptions of photos, maps, and logos (can be toggled off).

10. Uncensored Transcription: Preserves profanity and graphic language in historical records verbatim.

11. Encoding Safety: Automatically fixes "Mojibake" (garbled text like â€™ or Â) to ensure smooth reading.

Supported Formats
* Input: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, CSV, JS, JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, WEBP.
* Output: HTML, Plain Text, Word (.docx), Markdown (.md), PDF.



API PRICING: FREE TIER VS. PAY-AS-YOU-GO

Chronicle connects to the Google Gemini API, which offers a generous Free Tier for casual users and a Pay-As-You-Go tier for bulk archival processing.

FREE TIER LIMITS (How much can you scan for free?)
The free tier limits you by "Requests Per Day" (RPD). Chronicle groups PDFs into 5-page chunks, meaning 1 request = 5 pages.
* Standard Speed Engine (Gemini 2.5 Flash): 250 requests per day = Up to 1,250 pages per day for free.
* Deep Scan Engine (Gemini 2.5 Pro): 100 requests per day = Up to 500 pages per day for free.
Note: The free tier may occasionally pause or throttle requests if you hit the "Requests Per Minute" limit (10 RPM for Flash, 5 RPM for Pro).

PAY-AS-YOU-GO COST CALCULATOR
If you add a credit card to your Google Cloud account to unlock unlimited scanning, the costs are incredibly low. 

Cost Assumptions: An average page of archival text contains roughly 500 words. When processing, Google charges for "Input" (reading the page) and "Output" (writing the formatted HTML/Text). 

1. Standard Speed Engine (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
Input Cost: $0.30 per 1 million tokens.
Output Cost: $2.50 per 1 million tokens.
Estimated Cost Per Page: ~$0.0014 (about one-tenth of a cent).

* Small Job (50 pages): $0.07
* Medium Job (500 pages): $0.70
* Really Big Volume (5,000 pages): $7.00

2. Deep Scan Engine (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
Input Cost: $1.25 per 1 million tokens.
Output Cost: $10.00 per 1 million tokens.
Estimated Cost Per Page: ~$0.0056 (about half a cent).

* Small Job (50 pages): $0.28
* Medium Job (500 pages): $2.81
* Really Big Volume (5,000 pages): $28.13

TROUBLESHOOTING AND WARNINGS

When scanning highly compressed or poorly exported archival documents, your terminal or screen reader may read out a rapid series of warnings.

Warning: Ignoring wrong pointing object X 0 (offset 0)
MEANING: The PDF has a corrupted internal index. The internal map that points to text and images is broken.
ACTION REQUIRED: None. You can safely ignore this. Chronicle's underlying engine automatically detects the broken map, bypasses it, and successfully forces a manual, page-by-page scan instead. The script has been updated to automatically silence these specific warnings so they do not interrupt your screen reader.

Warning: Object X 0 not defined
MEANING: The PDF's internal code is trying to load a specific element, like a blank page or invisible font, that does not actually exist in the file.
ACTION REQUIRED: None. The script will automatically skip the missing object and continue extracting the readable text.
