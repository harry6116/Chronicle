CHRONICLE PROJECT: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING LOG

A chronological overview of document stress-tests, edge cases, and accessibility evaluations conducted to refine the Chronicle extraction engine.

PHASE 1: TECHNICAL MANUALS AND INLINE ICONOGRAPHY

Objective: Force the AI to translate visual, inline UI symbols into explicit spoken text for screen reader compatibility, moving beyond standard OCR.

1. Casio 5611 (GA-2100 Series) Watch Manual
   - Focus: Physical button mapping and non-standard layout parsing.
   - Result: Successfully intercepted tiny, dark-circle button symbols embedded mid-sentence and translated them into clear bracketed text (e.g., [Button A], [Button C]) without dropping configuration steps.

2. Zoom H6 Handy Recorder Manual
   - Focus: Digital transport controls, complex Table of Contents, and overall document chunking limits.
   - Result: Initially skipped introductory pages due to layout density and a high 10-page chunk limit. Triggered the critical Version 9.1/9.2 update, reducing PDF ingestion to strict 5-page chunks and re-establishing natural AI temperature to navigate the dense front matter perfectly.

3. The Torture Tests (Baofeng UV-5R and Tascam DR-05X)
   - Focus: Extreme manual hostility, including inverted-color icons, poorly translated flowchart paths, and symbol-only instructions.
   - Result: Validated the engine's ability to inject [Record Button] or [Scroll Up/Down Icon] where only low-resolution pixels existed.

PHASE 2: BUREAUCRACY AND FORM FLATTENING

Objective: Convert non-linear visual tables and forms into linear, navigable lists.

1. Australian Tax Forms
   - Focus: Checkbox state detection and XY spatial layout.
   - Result: Implemented the "Flattening Logic" which instructs the Vision model to ignore visual coordinates and output Field -> Value structures.

2. US Standard Form 86 (SF-86)
   - Focus: Massive document scale (136 pages) and hallucination suppression.
   - Result: Served as the ultimate test for AI constraint, ensuring the model rigidly reported blank fields rather than creatively inventing data to fill the void.

PHASE 3: MILITARY ARCHIVES AND HISTORICAL INTEGRITY

Objective: Reconstruct highly abbreviated, unpunctuated, and damaged historical records into seamless audio narratives.

1. World War I War Diaries and Orders
   - Focus: Unit abbreviations, military syntax, and OCR text bleeding.
   - Result: Successfully expanded "2nd Bn, Queen's Regt." into "2nd Battalion, Queen's Regiment." Successfully decoupled merged OCR artifacts (e.g., separating page numbers from adjacent sentences like "2 of 3he").

2. Trench Map Grid References
   - Focus: Controlling VoiceOver dictation cadence for numbers.
   - Result: Engine correctly isolated references like "J. 13. b. Central" and injected spacing to force the screen reader to dictate characters methodically.

PHASE 4: ENCODING AND AUDIO RHYTHM PRESERVATION

Objective: Eliminate all garbled text artifacts that cause screen reader stuttering.

1. The Mojibake Assassination
   - Focus: Eradicating corrupted UTF-8 outputs generated by AI "smart" punctuation.
   - Result: Implemented the Python scrubber patch (Version 8.1) to actively hunt and destroy non-breaking space errors and the rogue "Â" symbol before it could reach the audio output buffer.

PHASE 5: BATCH PROCESSING AND WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

Objective: Scale the tool from single-file analysis to mass-archival processing without user intervention.

1. The Yunzii Manual & Recursive Scan
   - Focus: Recursion logic, file naming integrity, and terminal noise suppression.
   - Result: Validated "Menu 9" capability to scan sub-folders. Identified and fixed a Python logging issue where corrupt PDF tables (Offset 0 errors) were flooding the terminal. Implemented auto-cleanup logic to safely delete original files only after successful HTML conversion.
