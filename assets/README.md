# Chronicle Assets and Samples

This folder contains sample inputs and outputs to demonstrate the engine's capabilities. 

### Accessibility Commitment
For every visual asset (PDF or Screenshot) in this folder, there is a corresponding semantic version:
1. Visual Samples: Located in /samples.
2. Screen Reader Versions: Located in /samples/text_versions as accessible HTML or Markdown.
3. Alt-Text: All images in the main repository documentation include descriptive alt-text for VoiceOver users.
